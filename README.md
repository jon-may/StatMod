# StatMod
statistical moderation of marks

Some basic R commands to compare the distribution of marks from different markers, using the file
exported from the DLE or after moderation from the Module Boxes.
Does a oneway anova, pairwise comparisons (TUkey's HSD) and plain pairwise t tests.
Basic frequency histogram too. Could do better visualisation.
